Short quick-start guide:

execute the following commands in a terminal:
   cd opencv
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make

Now the executables should be built and you can run the openCV analysis tools on your images!
In the build folder, run:
   ./transforms cube.png cube
which should open several windows, one with the original image and the detected image. 
The cartesian output will exist in a file called cube.CDCODE.
